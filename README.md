The nydus project implements a content-addressable filesystem on top of a RAFS format that improves the current OCI image specification, in terms of container launching speed, image space, and network bandwidth efficiency, as well as data integrity.

The following benchmarking result shows the performance improvement compared with the OCI image for the container cold startup elapsed time on containerd. As the OCI image size increases, the container startup time of using Nydus image remains very short.

Nydus' key features include:

- Container images can be downloaded on demand in chunks for lazy pulling to boost container startup
- Chunk-based content-addressable data de-duplication to minimize storage, transmission and memory footprints
- Merged filesystem tree in order to remove all intermediate layers as a option
- in-kernel EROFS or FUSE filesystem together with overlayfs to provide full POSIX compatibility
- E2E image data integrity check. So security issues like "Supply Chain Attach" can be avoided and detected at runtime
- Compatible with the OCI artifacts spec and distribution spec, so nydus image can be stored in a regular container registry
- Various container image storage backends are supported. For example, Registry, NAS, Aliyun/OSS.
- Integrated with CNCF incubating project Dragonfly to distribute container images in P2P fashion and mitigate the pressure on container registries
- Capable to prefetch data block before user IO hits the block thus to reduce read latency
- Record files access pattern during runtime gathering access trace/log, by which user abnormal behaviors are easily caught
- Access trace based prefetch table
- User I/O amplification to reduce the amount of small requests to storage backend.

Currently Nydus includes following tools:

To try nydus image service:

1. Convert an original OCI image to nydus image and store it somewhere like Docker/Registry, NAS or Aliyun/OSS. This can be directly done by `nydusify`. Normal users don't have to get involved with `nydus-image`.
2. Get `nydus-snapshotter`(`containerd-nydus-grpc`) installed locally and configured properly. Or install `nydus-docker-graphdriver` plugin.
3. Operate container in legacy approaches. For example, `docker`, `nerdctl`, `crictl` and `ctr`.

## Build Binary

```shell
# build debug binary
make
# build release binary
make release
# build static binary with docker
make docker-static
```

## Quick Start with Kubernetes and Containerd

For more details on how to lazily start a container with `nydus-snapshotter` and nydus image on Kubernetes nodes or locally use `nerdctl` rather than CRI, please refer to [Nydus Setup](./docs/containerd-env-setup.md)

## Build Nydus Image

Build Nydus image from directory source: [Nydus Image Builder](./docs/nydus-image.md).

Convert OCI image to Nydus image: [Nydusify](./docs/nydusify.md).

## Nydus Snapshotter

Nydus-snapshotter is a non-core sub-project of containerd.

Check out its code and tutorial from [Nydus-snapshotter repository](https://github.com/containerd/nydus-snapshotter).
It works as a `containerd` remote snapshotter to help setup container rootfs with nydus images, which handles nydus image format when necessary. When running without nydus images, it is identical to the containerd's builtin overlayfs snapshotter.

## Run Nydusd Daemon

Normally, users do not need to start `nydusd` by hand. It is started by `nydus-snapshotter` or `nydus-docker-graphdriver` when a container rootfs is prepared.

Run Nydusd Daemon to serve Nydus image: [Nydusd](./docs/nydusd.md).

## Build Images via Harbor

Nydus cooperates with Harbor community to develop [acceleration-service](https://github.com/goharbor/acceleration-service) which provides a general service for Harbor to support image acceleration based on kinds of accelerators like Nydus, eStargz, etc.

## Docker graph driver support

Docker graph driver is also accompanied, it helps to start container from nydus image. For more particular instructions, please refer to

- [Nydus Graph Driver](./contrib/docker-nydus-graphdriver/README.md)
